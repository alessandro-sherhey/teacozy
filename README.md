# teacozy
This is the Codecademy project you find after completing the Flexbox chapter. I did the project and I improved it further, by adding new features:
- Light Mode
- Complete responsiveness
- Animations for :hover and :active states
- Modernized design

If you have any ideas on how to improve the design feel free to write them in Issues! :)
